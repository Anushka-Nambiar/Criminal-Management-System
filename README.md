## Introduction
### Purpose of this project
<p align="justify">
  The main purpose of our project is automating the traditional way of storing criminal records.
Here, we could add, update and delete criminal records. We could also add, update and delete
FIR details which are being filed down manually traditionally. We store all the data into a
database from where we could use it further. Thus this project provides a very user friendly
interface for the officials to store and manage the criminal records. 
</p>

### Project Objective

records. It also aims at providing a user friendly interface for effortless interaction with the
user.

developments of the project, we could integrate it with AI and make features such as face
detections.
